JAX-WS Maven Plugin

  This plugin contains Maven adapter for {{{http://jax-ws.java.net/}JAX-WS}}'s toolset.
  
  The original code was developed in the Codehaus Mojo project, then as of March 2007,
  the project moved to {{{https://jax-ws-commons.java.net/jaxws-maven-plugin/}jax-ws-commons}}
  with version 1.x in {{{https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/codehaus/mojo/jaxws-maven-plugin/}org.codehaus.mojo groupId}}
  and version 2.x in {{{https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/jvnet/jax-ws-commons/jaxws-maven-plugin/}org.jvnet.jax-ws-commons groupId}}. 
  
  In September 2015, for version 2.4, it went back to MojoHaus (the new home of Codehaus Mojo)
  in {{{https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/org/codehaus/mojo/jaxws-maven-plugin/}org.codehaus.mojo groupId}}.

  * {{{./wsgen-mojo.html}jaxws:wsgen}}: reads a service endpoint implementation class
     and generates all of the portable artifacts for a JAX-WS web service.
